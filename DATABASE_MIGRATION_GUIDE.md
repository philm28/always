## What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Common Issues:

1. **"relation already exists" error**
   - This means tables already exist
   - You can safely ignore this error

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project
   - Check that you have admin access

3. **Syntax errors**
   - Make sure you copied the ENTIRE migration file
   - Don't modify the SQL content

### Getting Help:
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error message carefully
2. Try refreshing the Supabase dashboard
3. Make sure you're in the correct project

## After Migration Success

Once your migration runs successfully:

1. **Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled** - This protects user data
2. **Policies are created** - Users can only access their own data
3. **Indexes are added** - For better performance
4. **Triggers are set up** - For automatic timestamp updates
